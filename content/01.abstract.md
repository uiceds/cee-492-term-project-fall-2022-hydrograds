## CEE 492 Final Project Selection 
1. Dataset description:

The dataset used in this project is a `CSV` file about the air quality in northern Taiwan collected in 2015 [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelsonchu/air-quality-in-northern-taiwan], which include air quality data and meteorological monitoring data for research and analysis, originally from Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, R.O.C. (Taiwan). There are 25 observation stations in total. Columns in this CSV file are the following:

1. Time - The first column is the observation time of 2015

2. Station - The second column is the station name, there are 25 observation stations, those stations are showing at the table @tbl:1.

## Proposal:
The purpose of this project is to predict O~3~ concentrations using measurements of concentration of other pollutants and available meteorological measurements.  Ozone might be formed when heat and sunlight cause chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NO~x~) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), which are also known as Hydrocarbons. Therefore it could be hypothesized that using measurements of NO~x~ as an independent variable a model could be developed to predict O~3~ concentrations. Additionally, meteorological variables such as air temperature, relative humidity(RH) and ultraviolet index (UVB - UVI) could be included as independent variables to assess their influence on temporal variability of ozone. As an additional step wind-related variables such as mean wind velocity and direction will be included to study their effect on temporal variability of ozone.

After the air quality data has been processed the strongest O~3~ predictors will be determined using PCA. PCA could be used to identify the main axes of variance within the dataset and explore underlying correlations that exist in a set of variables. Variables that are highly correlated cluster together. Using PCA 2D figures per each pair of variables are not needed, instead all the variables could be visualized simultaneously. Differences on PC1 are more important than differences on PC2. After plotting PCA plots, a heatmap could also be plotted to check the results. As additional criteria to identify the strongest predictors a LSTM network (long short-term memory network) can be used since the data used is time dependent. The network should contain several LSTM layers and fully-connected layers. The output should contain the pollution concentration and will point out the weights assigned to each correlated criterion, the values of such weights should also indicate what the strongest predictors are. Once the strongest predictors have been identified, genetic programming will be used to develop the models to predict O~3~ concentrations.
