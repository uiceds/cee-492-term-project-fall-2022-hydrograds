## Proposal:
The purpose of this project is to predict O~3~ concentrations using measurements of concentration of other pollutants and available meteorological measurements.  Ozone might be formed when heat and sunlight cause chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NO~x~) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), which are also known as Hydrocarbons. Therefore it could be hypothesized that using measurements of NO~x~ as an independent variable a model could be developed to predict O~3~ concentrations. Additionally, meteorological variables such as air temperature, relative humidity(RH) and ultraviolet index (UVB - UVI) could be included as independent variables to assess their influence on temporal variability of ozone. As an additional step wind-related variables such as mean wind velocity and direction will be included to study their effect on temporal variability of ozone.

After the air quality data has been processed the strongest O~3~ predictors will be determined using PCA. PCA could be used to identify the main axes of variance within the dataset and explore underlying correlations that exist in a set of variables. Variables that are highly correlated cluster together. Using PCA 2D figures per each pair of variables are not needed, instead all the variables could be visualized simultaneously. Differences on PC1 are more important than differences on PC2. After plotting PCA plots, a heatmap could also be plotted to check the results. As additional criteria to identify the strongest predictors a LSTM network (long short-term memory network) can be used since the data used is time dependent. The network should contain several LSTM layers and fully-connected layers. The output should contain the pollution concentration and will point out the weights assigned to each correlated criterion, the values of such weights should also indicate what the strongest predictors are. Once the strongest predictors have been identified, genetic programming will be used to develop the models to predict O~3~ concentrations.

The independent variables were segmented in pollutants and meteorological measurements. In order to visualize how the measurements change throughout the year the values were average per month. Then the resulting values were standardized using their mean. Once the values were standardized they were plotted against time.

As seen in the previous figure, O3 peaked in the months when concentration of the nitrogen based pollutants and non-methane hydrocarbons dropped. This is especially the case for NO concentrations (green line). This pattern of corresponding decreasing pollutant concentrations and increasing ozone could suggest that the pollutant concentrations are negatively correlated with ozone concentrations. This is also consistent with figure … (correlation plot)
In regards to the meteorological variables, UVB (ultraviolet index) and air temperature peak in the same months. Both temperature and UVB experience and increase in their values from the beginning of the year peaking in June. After June, both values experience a steady decrease. No discernable pattern can be observed in terms of the relation of the latter two variables and ozone concentrations. 
Wind direction values are telling of changes in direction with respect to yearly average direction. The increase or decrease of the values shown in figure… correspond to a relative shift in direction of the wind compared to the yearly wind direction. These shifts in the direction of the wind can be used later on the forecasting of O3 concentration. Wind direction could help elucidate if O3 concentration from upwind neighboring locations could affect O3 values in the location of interest, Banquiao.
